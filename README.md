# FL-Research-Highlight

**The purpose of this work is to follow the state-of-the-art works on Federated Learning**

## Survey

- [Federated Learning for Generalization,Robustness, Fairness: A Survey and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.06750.pdf) - *ArXiv’23*

  They argue that **Generalization, Robustness, and Fairness** interact with each other to jointly enhance the practical federation deployment and this is the first work to simultaneously investigate the related research development and uniformly benchmark multi-view experimental analysis on the Generalization, Robustness, and Fairness realms.

- [Heterogeneous federated learning: State-of-the-art and research challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10616.pdf) - *ACM Computing Surveys‘23*

  They summarize the various research challenges in HFL from five aspects: **statistical heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, communication heterogeneity, device heterogeneity, and additional challenges.** They classify existing methods from three different levels according to the HFL procedure: **data-level, model-level, and server-level**. 

## Baseline

- **FedAvg**: [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/mcmahan17a/mcmahan17a.pdf) - *PMLR’17*

  Google built a basic paradigm for federated learning.
